Hello, my name is **Thi Huynh** _(also known as Thi IT)_, I was born and raised in Central - Vietnam

#### 1. Website design: Passion and reality...
<small>from 2004...</small>

I am passionate about website design, but up to this point (nearly 20 years after I participated in building my first website) I still can't be ranked among the experts who build websites...

From the time I started working, I also went through many different jobs, but my passion and predestined relationship with the web, in what stage and in the flow of technology development, I also more or less self-taught and experimented with construction. build websites using many different technologies _(starting with .Net, then php, 2012 Doctrine ORM, 2014 Ruby on Rails, 2018 React, 2021 Flutter; Wordpress with Beaver Builder framework, and now Jekyll...)_

I love building websites but I don't fully invest time in it _(what a contradiction!?)_, I have refesh and re-start many times but success _(for myself)_ has not come yet,

At work, there are many colleagues who say that I am more suitable for a career in human resources _(sometimes I also see that)_, but after time, it is just a misconception.

I love to code, love to code but I have never surpassed myself to code a good project; I still ponder and swim in invisible choices

_there's more..._
